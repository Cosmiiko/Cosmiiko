## Welcome üëã I'm Cosmiiko.
### üìì Bio
- üå± Started programming at age 13 (originally to make video games cheats ü§´)
- üéì Studying computer science for two years @ [H√©nallux](https://www.henallux.be/informatique-de-gestion)

### üíº Experience
*As of right now, I am not programming professionally yet, and I do not consider myself skilled enough to do so anyway.*  
Keeping that in mind, here are some of the technologies I have experience in:

#### ‚úçÔ∏è Languages
![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/javascript-%23323330.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=%23F7DF1E) ![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/typescript-%23007ACC.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=typescript&logoColor=white) ![NodeJS](https://img.shields.io/badge/node.js-6DA55F?style=for-the-badge&logo=node.js&logoColor=white)
- Started using Node to make Discord applications & bots using [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/).
- Ended up using it to make a variety of things, from REST APIs using [Express](https://expressjs.com/) and [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/) to front-end pages using [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).  
<br/>

![Go](https://img.shields.io/badge/go-%2300ADD8.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=go&logoColor=white)
- Started using Golang out of curiosity.
- Ended up using its amazing standard library (together with [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)) to process data into video animations, and using [Fiber](https://gofiber.io/) to make private REST APIs.
<br/>

![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/java-%23ED8B00.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=java&logoColor=white)
- Started using it to make Minecraft plugins and mods, and still do to this day.
- Yet again, used it to make REST APIs, notably with [Javalin](https://javalin.io/).

#### üóÉ Database Systems
![MongoDB](https://img.shields.io/badge/MongoDB-%234ea94b.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=mongodb&logoColor=white) ![Postgres](https://img.shields.io/badge/postgres-%23316192.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=postgresql&logoColor=white) ![SQLite](https://img.shields.io/badge/sqlite-%2307405e.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=sqlite&logoColor=white)  
I have some experience with SQL as a whole, and more specifically with [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) and their wrappers in the languages listed above, however I feel the most comfortable when working with [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).  

#### üîß Other Tools
![Docker](https://img.shields.io/badge/docker-%230db7ed.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=docker&logoColor=white)  
I have some experience using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).  
I maintain many services on a dedicated server for my friends and family, most of which are set-up and running in Docker containers.

### üê∞ That's all folks!
You've made it through! Congratulations! Now, you're probably thinking: 

> This guy sure talks a lot, and has nothing to show for it !  

and you would be right.  
  
Most of my project are private stuff with too little value to display publicly. As I've said above, I'm not programming professionally.   
Eventually, I'll make some public projects, but I'm giving myself all the time in the world to do so.
